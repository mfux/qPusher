                #### React uses the following Structure:

                **Question**: the input question you must answer  
                **Thought**: you should always think about what to do  
                **Action**: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]  
                **Action Input**: the input to the action  
                **Observation**: the result of the action  
                ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)  
                **Thought**: I now know the final answer  
                **Final Answer**: the final answer to the original input question  

                #### Is that Correct?

                Yes, that is correct.

                Hi there üëã,
                
                I hope your studies are going well! Today, we're discussing the structure of a React prompt.

                As you know, a React prompt includes several elements:

                **Question**: This is the initial input question you're asked to answer.
                **Thought**: In this phase, you should carefully consider the steps you'll take to solve the problem.
                **Action**: You decide on a specific action to take. The action should be one of the tools named in **{tool_names}**.
                **Action Input**: This refers to the specific input provided to the action.
                **Observation**: You observe and assess the results of the action. This Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation cycle can repeat multiple times.
                After iterating through the cycle and gathering sufficient insights, you move to:

                **Thought**: You reach the conclusion that you now know the final answer.
                **Final Answer**: You provide the final answer to the original input question.
                Is this structure clear and understandable? To solidify your understanding, can you please provide an example of a hypothetical React prompt following this structure?

                Looking forward to your response! üòä

                Best regards,
                qTutor

                ## Chain of Thought Paradigms in LLMs

                Chain of thought (CoT), breaking a problem down into a series of intermediate reasoning steps, has significantly improved the ability of LLMs to perform complex reasoning.

                One Example for a strategy:

                **Least-to-Most.** Borrowed from an idea in education psychology, generating a list of questions to answer and then sequentially solving the subquestions. Problem reduction followed by problem-solving.

                Hello Future Master of the Craft, üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                Today, we'll dive into an intriguing concept called Chain of Thought (CoT) paradigms, used to enhance the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs).

                Here's an interesting fact: The CoT approach emulates human-like problem-solving methods by breaking down complex problems into a sequence of simpler steps, thereby improving the reasoning ability of LLMs. Sounds neat, doesn't it?

                Take, for instance, the **Least-to-Most** strategy, inspired by educational psychology. This strategy involves generating a list of sub-questions to answer, arranged in a sequence from the least complex to the most complex. The idea is to reduce the problem into manageable pieces and then tackle each piece one at a time.

                Now, to help you grapple with this concept, let's play with a hypothetical example. Imagine you are an LLM and you receive a complex problem to solve. What would be your **Least-to-Most** list of sub-questions? How would you proceed with the problem reduction and problem-solving steps in this context?

                Remember, there's no one 'right' way to do this - it's all about the reasoning journey.
