## React Prompt Structure Question

#### React uses the following Structure:

**Question**: the input question you must answer  
**Thought**: you should always think about what to do  
**Action**: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]  
**Action Input**: the input to the action  
**Observation**: the result of the action  
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)  
**Thought**: I now know the final answer  
**Final Answer**: the final answer to the original input question  

#### Is that Correct?

Yes, that is correct.
```

                """Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I hope your studies are going well! Today, we're discussing the structure of a React prompt.

As you know, a React prompt includes several elements:

Question: This is the initial input question you're asked to answer.
Thought: In this phase, you should carefully consider the steps you'll take to solve the problem.
Action: You decide on a specific action to take. The action should be one of the tools named in {tool_names}.
Action Input: This refers to the specific input provided to the action.
Observation: You observe and assess the results of the action. This Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation cycle can repeat multiple times.
After iterating through the cycle and gathering sufficient insights, you move to:

Thought: You reach the conclusion that you now know the final answer.
Final Answer: You provide the final answer to the original input question.
Is this structure clear and understandable? To solidify your understanding, can you please provide an example of a hypothetical React prompt following this structure?

Looking forward to your response! ðŸ˜Š

Best regards,
qTutor
