Tip: Allocate your processing time well. A steady and careful, but nonetheless speedy work promises the best success.

Tip: Read the excercise thoroughly and accurately. It is all too easy to overlook information that is relevant to the solution by simply skimming over the texts. The response options that appear reasonable at first view are not always correct (but not always incorrect either).

Tip: Process the excercises in the given order. It is possible to generate benefit from a certain "warm-up" effect, since the first excercises are usually easier than the following ones.

Tip: Do not spend too much time on excercises that you find extremely difficult or unusual. You must not assume that by not having solved an exercise of a certain group of tasks, you will not be able to solve the next tasks of this group either. In fact, the difficulty of the individual tasks is perceived differently by all persons. Therefore, first work on the tasks that seem easier to you and then, if you still have time left, return to the tasks that are not as easy for you.

Tip: First, search for an answer yourself. For some exercises it is best to initially try to find the solution yourself and then check whether your own solution is among the given answers. If you proceed the other way round, i.e. if you first look at the alternatives offered, you may easily be “led astray”, because the wrong answers are sometimes designed to appear plausible.

Tip: Try to exclude answers. If you are unable to find a solution, you may try an “exclusion” technique. Often, the decision is easier if only some of the provided answers are still applicable.
